# MobileAccessGateway

The MobileAccessGateway is an implementation based on the [CH EPR mHealth](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-mhealth/index.html) [(CI-Build)](http://build.fhir.org/ig/ehealthsuisse/ch-epr-mhealth/index.html) implementation guide.  
It provides a FHIR Gateway supporting the PMIR and MHD server actors and uses XDS/PIXV3 to communicate with an XDS Affinity Domain.

It uses [IPF](https://oehf.github.io/ipf/) and [HAPI-FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/).
