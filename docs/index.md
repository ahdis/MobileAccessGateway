# Mobile Access Gateway

The [Mobile Access Gateway (MAG)](https://www.mobileaccessgateway.ch/) is an implementation based on the [CH EPR FHIR Implementation Guide (IG)](https://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-fhir/index.html). It provides a FHIR gateway that supports the mobile IHE server actors and translates them into IHE XDS/HL7v3 transactions.

It uses [IPF](https://oehf.github.io/ipf/) and [HAPI-FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/).

You can find more details about its [features](features.md), available [endpoints](endpoints.md), [Docker container](docker.md) setup, and [change history](changelog.md) in the documentation. A more complete description of the [transactions required for the EPR integration of primary systems](integration-primary-system.md) is also provided.

For further information, see the [website](https://www.mobileaccessgateway.ch/) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ahdis/MobileAccessGateway).
